# grain-storage-monitoring-system-using-I2C-protocol-
An FPGA-based Verilog simulation that models I²C communication and automated temperature–humidity control for grain storage monitoring. The system uses threshold-based logic to trigger virtual actuators like fan, heater, cooler, and buzzer for maintaining safe storage conditions.

🔍 Project Overview
Grain stored in warehouses must be maintained within safe temperature and humidity limits to prevent spoilage, mold, and insect activity. 
This simulation models:
-I²C communication protocol
-Threshold-based decision-making
-Automatic actuator control
-Real-time response through FPGA parallel logic
-Thresholds used (FAO & USDA recommendations):
  -Temperature: 20°C – 30°C
  -Humidity: 45% – 65%
